# ApiMinimal
Welcome to our minimal API example! This project is designed to showcase the simplicity and efficiency of building a web API using the minimal API approach in .NET 6.

The project includes a single endpoint that returns a JSON response containing a list of users. The endpoint is defined in a single file, Program.cs, using a streamlined syntax that requires minimal boilerplate code.
